> This is a testing archive that can be paired with atmosphere 1.9.0 testing one (20.0.0 support). If you don't know what you are doing, it's generally better to wait for the proper releases.

> **Please note:** You should only use this if you are already comfortable with atmosphere, and don't need help with very basic support issues. There may still be issues I don't know about, even though I fixed the only known issue reported with the QA testing build.
